# `Turborepo` starter

This project uses `Turborepo` to manage the monorepo.

## Runing the project

Run the following command at the root of the project (where this README is located):

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server for both the backend and the frontend on parallel
(no need to run `npm run dev` for each).
